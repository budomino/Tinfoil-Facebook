# Tinfoil for Facebook (Defaults-to-Messenger Fork)

## Description (from F-Droid)

Browse Facebook's mobile web site with a simple web browser, which is completely sandboxed in order to protect your privacy by avoiding other pages to track your browsing history.

The COARSE_LOCATION permission is only used if you enable "Allow Check-ins" on the preferences section, which is disabled by default.

## Changes in this fork

I love that this application still works in 2021. However, I've found that I only really want to use Facebook for its messaging capabilities and the occassional Facebook group discussion. While I can easily do that from a mobile browser, this app is slightly more convenient and is still capable of sandboxing Facebook from everything else. So I hid/commented all references to the newsfeed and set its homepage to the Messages page. This should also keep me from idly browsing every time I open the app (you'd be surprised how difficult it is to stop)
